# Employee Review System

This app is my take on Employee Review System application. This is for the solution of coding ninjas skill test (Backend Express).
Let's go over all the individual pages and various functionality of my application.

## Landing Screen.

As you can see this is the landing page for my app. Here you can register as a new employee or you can go to the login page directly using the `Already have an account ? Sign in!` button.

## Login Page

So this is the login page. If you already have your credentials then you can login directly. If you need to register yourself then you can use the `Don't Have an account? Sign Up!` button and it will redirect you to the Register User Page.
